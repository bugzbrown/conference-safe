# conference-safe

## DISCLAIMER

This is a very first initial draft of an idea that I hope will either become a useful tool or be discarded as an idiotic idea.

Please feel free to reach out to and give me feedback, complaints, suggestions, ideas or what not. The idea of this project is to be 100% public.

## Intro

This project is still in the conception phase. Don't expect much in terms of code here right now.
The initial idea behind this project is to find out ways of keeping people feeling safe during a conference. The basic idea of this came from a series of tweets I've bees seeing, where, people have stated that they are not feeling safe at tech conferences. The tweets are mainly from women in the tech industry. I find it safe to infer that, there is a big number of people who do not feel safe at
conferences, independent of gender, race, creed, industry, and any other number of combining factors.

This idea is based on an idea that I've seen and used with cycling. There are groups of people known generically as "Bike Angels" who, organize groups of cyclists allowing for a safer cycling experience. The main difference is that Bike Angles usually determine the days they will cycle as a group, and people join in. Here, we'd need to organize the groups on an event basis.

## The initial idea - the seed

The initial idea, the 'seed' so to speak was to create a "vetting system" for "angels/groups". Yes, it was as bad as it sounds...
Before you bash me... The idea works "kind-of" like this:

Let's say there is a tech conference in SP next month. Not a really big one that I want to go to. I sign up for the conference, and, I also
go to the "conference-safe" site, and advise that I will be going to the conference.

Now, Alex hears about this conference, but does not feel safe going alone, but Alex really wants to go. Alex looks up the "conference-safe" site
to see if there is anybody going. Alex finds "N" people that will be attending there, looks at my ratings and ~~comments that have been made about me~~.

Alex sends the people a "I'll be going too" of some sorts. From there, they can create a small group of people that will be "vetted" as safe.

After the conference is over, Alex is sent an email, asking to review the conference. The system give Alex the option of rating not only the conference, but the people that have attended the conference, giving tem ratings from 1 - N.

Alex may at any time, decide to become an "angel" too.

## Where could we go from here

This could be used eventually by conferences. People that are highly ranked could be invited to more conferences in essence making them a safer environment for all.

The small minded idiots who make conferences unpleasant and even dangerous at times, would, because of the increasing number of "protecting" people, either realize that they were being assholes, or, feel un-welcomed.
